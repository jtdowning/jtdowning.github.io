Welcome! 

I am currently a student at Tech Elevator studying Java language.  Thanks for checking my github out! I am in the process of organizing different capstones and projects that I am working on.

I have a passion for learning new technology, currently my intrests are raspberry Pi, SQL, Java, Ruby, Selenium, Postgres, and MDM.  All of these area I look forward to learn, grow, and apply to my career.

Thanks for stopping by!

Jon
