Welcome! 
I am currently a student at Tech Elevator studying Java language.  Thanks for checking my github out! I am in the process of organizing different capstones and projects that I am working on.

I am working on a database for SeanStrahan.com; I am about 65% of the way completed and look to have it up and running here soon.

Thanks again for stopping by!

Jon
